# Conways-Game-Of-Life

An implemention in Rust of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) made by John Conway. This is work in progress.

To run the game, use:

`cargo run start 1y 1x 2y 2x ... Ny Nx`

The start functionality will print the status of the current generation, and advance to the next generation every 3 seconds.

In the next versions, there will be easier to pick the points, via UI.
